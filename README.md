# PuppySuperBowl

This is a unit project that demonstrates my ability to work with an API, and use a variety of concepts, such as: Async/await, try/catch, fetch, GET, POST, and DELETE.

## User Story:
Based on Calliope's email:
* You are working with the humane society to add a mini-game to their website.
* The game should allow visitors to see teams of puppies compete in a "puppy bowl".
* Someone has already built out the API and some of the front end.
* Work with your team to plan and implement using GitHub Project. 
* You will be provided with the GitHub link to any existing work that has been done. 

Overall, your job is to build out a functional client side. Request data from the API, then render that data on the front end. The front end should allow the user to: 

* View the roster.
* Observe a player's details.
* Add players to the roster.
* Etc.
All the data you need is available through the API. Your job is to leverage it.
